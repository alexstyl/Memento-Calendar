Memento Calendar is a modern namedays app for Android.
This repository contains the source code of Memento Calendar.

You can get started by having a look at the project's wiki. It contains some information about how to get Memento up and running on your machine and other useful info.

This repo is open for PRs and they are more than welcome! Have a look [at the wiki page to see how to contribute](https://github.com/alexstyl/Memento-Calendar/wiki/How-to-contribute).

## Project Goal
Memento Calendar is my pet project/playground in which I experiment with various platform features development patterns and share my foundings with the community my foundings via blog posts and talks. Memento started off as a side project app back in 2014 and has been on development on and off. Current goal of the project is to split out the business logic of the app from the app logic so that it could potentially be ported into other platforms with the help of Kotlin.

## Modules
The app is split into multiple modules. 
The business logic of the app can be found in the **memento** module. There are three other Android Modules: 

### android_common
This is the shared resources across all Android specific modules. It depends on *memento*.

### android_wear
This is the Android Wear module. It depends on *android_common*.

### android_mobile
This is the Android mobile app module. It depends on *android_common*.

## Architecture
The Model-View-Presenter is used in order to architecture the app. 

**Presenters** are platform agnostic and live in the **memento** module, in order to be able to be used across all platforms. They contain the core logic of forwarding *Models* to the *Views*. It is up for the specific platform component to create a View

**Views** are responsible displaying information back to the user. For each view there is one interface that lives in the memento module. A view is not to be confused with Android's View classes, Activities or Fragments. 

**Models** contain the minimum amount of information needed to render the information on the screen.

I did a talk in the GDG Android Athens about the structure of Memento Calendar. The talk is in Greek, but the slides contain more information about the structure [(see the slides)](https://speakerdeck.com/alexstyl/the-journey-towards-a-platform-agnostic-codebase).
